# FDT_based_workload_orchestration
A workload orchestration algorithm that is based on Rienforcement Learning and Fuzzy Decision Trees

This algorithm is the one presented in:
Mechalikh, C., Taktak, H., & Moussa, F. (2020, April). A Fuzzy Decision Tree Based Tasks Orchestration Algorithm for Edge Computing Environments. In International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (pp. 193-203). Springer, Cham.

 To run this example, you need to download [PureEdgeSim](https://github.com/CharafeddineMechalikh/PureEdgeSim)
 Then, place the "MyWork" folder within the PureEdgeSim/ directory and you are ready to start. To run the example, execute the Main class "MyWork/Main.java"
